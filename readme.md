SSAS Icons
==================

To browse all of the icons, go to:
[https://swiftmade.github.io/ssas-icons/](https://swiftmade.github.io/ssas-icons/)

This repository contains;

- icons used in School Safety Self Assessment Reports.
- swiftdocs plugin that gives you a ssas icon component. 


### Adding new icons

To add new icons, simply add your icons in png format to the correct folder in the `icons` directory.

**Rules for naming icons:**
- Make sure the file names are all lowercase and use dashes instead of spaces.
- Also, make sure the file names are unique. To see if an icon already exists, go to the [icons page](https://swiftmade.github.io/ssas-icons/).

After adding your icons, run the following command to rebuild the icons page:

```bash
php build.php
```

Create a PR and wait for the preview link to be generated by Netlify. Once the preview link is generated, you can see your icons in the preview link.

If you are happy with the result, you can release the new version.

### Releasing a new version

To release a new version, make sure package.json has the correct version number.  Tag this version number and make a release on Github.

After that, you can run `npm publish` to publish the new version to npm.
